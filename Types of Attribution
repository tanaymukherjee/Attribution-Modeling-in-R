Multi-Touch Attribution For Marketers

Single-Touch Attribution
For many businesses, single-touch attribution is the default mode of operations. Under this model, credit is given only to the first or last instance of contact before conversion. There is a familiar logic at play here: if this is the touch that most immediately preceded the conversion, it’s natural to assume there is some causation between the two. Conversely, if a particular campaign led to the lead in the first place, it deserves more credit than any others.

This model can work, but it can also leave your business open to some misleading information on ROI and revenue attribution. Many times, a customer’s path to converting involves many stops along the way. While the last one does contain inherent value (at the very least, it confirmed the positive feelings this person was already developing about your business), but giving all the revenue credit to one event ignores everything that happened before or after.

For example, if you tend to execute a certain kind of campaign – ebook promotion, for instance – for leads and opportunities who are in the middle of the buyer’s journey, a single-touch attribution model would consistently neglect the revenue-driving tole those campaigns play.
